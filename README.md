# 🤖 Machine Learning Basics – Linear & Logistic Regression | KNN Classifier & Regressor

Hey there! 👋  
This repo is a part of my hands-on journey in learning core **machine learning models**. I’ve explored and implemented the basics of:

- 🔹 Linear Regression  
- 🔹 Logistic Regression  
- 🔹 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier  
- 🔹 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor

These notebooks helped me understand how classic ML models work — both conceptually and practically — using real data.

## 📁 Files Overview

| File | ML Model Explored |
|------|--------------------|
| `linear_regression.ipynb` | Linear Regression (Supervised Regression) |
| `logistic_regression.ipynb` | Logistic Regression (Binary Classification) |
| `knn_classifier.ipynb` | KNN Classifier for Classification Tasks |
| `knn_regressor.ipynb` | KNN Regressor for Predicting Continuous Outputs |

Each file includes:
- Model intuition and math breakdown  
- Clean code implementation using **Scikit-learn**  
- Simple datasets (like Iris, Titanic, Boston Housing)  
- Evaluation metrics & plots
